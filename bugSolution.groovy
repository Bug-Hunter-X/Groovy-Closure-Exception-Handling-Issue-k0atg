```groovy
def methodWithClosure(closure) {
  println "Before closure execution"
  try {
    closure()
  } catch (Exception e) {
    println "Exception caught within the closure: ${e.message}"
  }
  println "After closure execution"
}

methodWithClosure {  
  //Some code here that throws exception
  println "Inside closure"
  throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!")
}
```
This improved version includes a `try-catch` block within the closure to handle the potential exception. The `println` statement after the closure will now execute normally and the exception message will be printed to the console.
